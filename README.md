The latest and gratest in fuck around and find out: Buaris, the best soon to be social media platform

Welcome to Buaris, the soon to be social media platform that promises to provide the worst code anyone has ever seen.
This platform is made for fun and will contain numerous bugs and crashes.
My mission is to make sure that your experience with Buaris is an entertaining one.

Here are some of the features you can expect from Buaris:

- Memory and Core Dumping every 25 minutes - this means that the program will crash and restart every 25 minutes, creating an unpredictable user experience. 

- Bugs and Glitches - we have implemented a number of bugs and glitches into the platform to make sure that you encounter something new every time you log in. 

- Poorly Written Code - Buaris is written with the worst code in mind. This means that you can expect a lot of strange behavior and unexpected results.

We hope that you enjoy your experience with Buaris! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me at marcovdt69@gmail.com.
